In this module, we'll learn all about stakeholders and their importance to a project. In the last set of videos, you learned the ins and outs of project scope. While exploring how a project can be in-scope or out-of-scope, you learned about setting SMART goals. We also discussed launching a project (getting it started) versus landing a project (whether or not it was successful). And there are a lot more exciting topics to come! In this module you'll learn more about stakeholders. Remember that stakeholders play a pivotal role. They are people who are interested in and affected by the project's completion and success. You'll see that each person involved has a set role and set responsibilities to help bring the project to a landing. Those roles include project sponsors, customers, team members, and of course, you, the project manager. You will also find out about things like stakeholder mapping and analysis and RACI charts. These are tools that help clarify roles and responsibilities and prevent confusion on who takes ownership of which tasks. Throughout this module, you'll have plenty of hands-on activities, discussion prompts, and readings to really help you master how to start a project. As we go through each new skill, imagine checking off a to-do list. There's almost nothing more satisfying than crossing off a to-do!
