This course will teach you how to set the stage for a successful project. You will learn about stakeholders, their level of influence, and how to mobilize and manage them, as well as tackle tasks to identify project scope, goals, deliverables, and success criteria. You will learn how to use tools like RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed) charts, stakeholder analysis, and project charters to help you set project expectations. You will also familiarize yourself with setting SMART (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-bound) goals to help you see the full scope of a project, determine its feasibility, and clearly define what project success will look like in concrete terms. Current Google project managers will continue to instruct and provide you with hands-on approaches for accomplishing these tasks, while implementing the right tools and resources for the job.
