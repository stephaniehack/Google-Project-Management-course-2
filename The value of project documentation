It’s PM’s job to keep track of every new decision and use those decisions to create a plan. 

That includes everything from identifying project goals and deliverables to choosing the right people to add to a team. It's way too much for any one person to mentally keep track of. It's also important information for everyone on the team to be aware of; not just the project manager.

Clear and consistent documentation can ensure transparency and clear communication. 

what problem are you trying to solve? What are the project goals? What are the scope and deliverables, and who are the project's stakeholders? Lastly, what resources does the team need to complete their work? This is all crucial information for anyone who's working on a project, regardless of their role.

It's your job to ensure that this information is easily accessible through some kind of formal documentation, like an e-mail, a presentation, or a digital document. Also, documenting decisions can help you uncover tasks, timelines, or costs you hadn't previously considered. And lastly, this process provides a historical record that can be reviewed at the end of your project.
